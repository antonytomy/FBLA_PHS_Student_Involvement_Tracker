# FBLA_PHS_Student_Involvement_Tracker
The project is to develop a computer program using an Express server with HTML, CSS, and JS to track student participation and attendance at school events. Points will be awarded for participation, and prizes will be given based on the accumulated points. The program will have a GUI with at least five different control types, and all data entry will be validated. The data will be stored persistently in a JSON file. The program must track at least five sporting events and five non-sports school events, and generate a report at the end of the quarter to show points per student in each grade. The program must also have a way to pick a random winner each quarter from each grade level and the student with the top point accumulation. Three prizes must be offered, including a school reward, a food reward, and a school spirit item.
